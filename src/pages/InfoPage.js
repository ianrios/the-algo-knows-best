                A short-form ambient concept album, designed for automated shuffling, allows listeners to craft new auditory experiences during each play. Here, a harmonic mixing strategy allows songs to seamlessly flow into one another regardless of order. User-created listening patterns will emerge from randomness based on preference, retention, and skips, among other metrics built into modern-day shuffling algorithms like song popularity and length.
